# Product Mission (Lite)

MCP GitLab is a Model Context Protocol server that enables LLMs to interact with GitLab repositories by providing a standardized interface for managing merge requests, issues, commits, and performing various Git operations through natural language commands.

MCP GitLab serves developers and DevOps engineers who need efficient GitLab automation through AI assistants. Unlike custom scripts or direct API integrations, MCP GitLab provides a standardized protocol with 30+ pre-built tools and local testing support, eliminating the complexity of GitLab API integration while enabling natural language control of GitLab workflows.
