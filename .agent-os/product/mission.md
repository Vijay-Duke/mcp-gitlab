# Product Mission

## Pitch

MCP GitLab is a Model Context Protocol server that enables LLMs to interact with GitLab repositories by providing a standardized interface for managing merge requests, issues, commits, and performing various Git operations through natural language commands.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Developers**: Software engineers who want to automate GitLab workflows through LLM assistants
- **Development Teams**: Teams looking to integrate AI assistants into their GitLab-based development processes

### User Personas

**DevOps Engineer** (25-45 years old)
- **Role:** Platform Engineer/DevOps Specialist
- **Context:** Managing multiple GitLab projects and CI/CD pipelines
- **Pain Points:** Repetitive GitLab operations, context switching between CLI and web interface
- **Goals:** Automate routine tasks, query project state through natural language

**Software Developer** (22-50 years old)
- **Role:** Full-stack/Backend Developer
- **Context:** Working on GitLab-hosted projects with frequent MR reviews and issue management
- **Pain Points:** Time spent on GitLab UI navigation, manual issue triage, MR management overhead
- **Goals:** Streamline workflow, quick access to project information, automated MR handling

## The Problem

### Manual GitLab Interaction Overhead

Developers spend significant time navigating GitLab's web interface or switching between CLI tools to perform routine operations. Studies show developers spend 20-30% of their time on non-coding activities.

**Our Solution:** Natural language interface to GitLab through LLMs, eliminating context switching.

### Complex API Integration

Building custom GitLab integrations requires understanding the GitLab API, handling authentication, and managing rate limits. This creates a high barrier to entry for automation.

**Our Solution:** Pre-built MCP server that handles all GitLab API complexity with simple tool interfaces.

## Differentiators

### Standardized Protocol

Unlike custom GitLab scripts or integrations, we use the Model Context Protocol standard. This ensures compatibility with any MCP-enabled LLM client without custom integration work.

### Comprehensive Tool Coverage

We provide 30+ pre-built tools covering projects, issues, MRs, commits, branches, pipelines, users, and more. This eliminates the need to build individual API integrations for each use case.

### Local Testing Support

Unlike other GitLab integrations, we include local testing stubs that allow development and testing without API calls. This results in faster development cycles and reduced API usage.
