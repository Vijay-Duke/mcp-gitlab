## 2025-01-09: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build MCP GitLab as a Model Context Protocol server that provides comprehensive GitLab integration for LLMs. The server will expose 30+ tools covering all major GitLab operations including projects, issues, merge requests, commits, branches, pipelines, and more. Target users are developers and teams who want to integrate AI assistants into their GitLab workflows.

### Context

The rise of LLM-powered development assistants creates a need for standardized integrations with development platforms. GitLab is a major DevOps platform used by millions of developers, but integrating it with LLMs typically requires custom API work. The Model Context Protocol provides a standard way to expose tools to LLMs.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom GitLab Bot**
   - Pros: Could be more tailored to specific use cases
   - Cons: Not reusable across different LLM platforms, requires custom integration

2. **GitLab CLI Wrapper**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation
   - Cons: Limited functionality, poor error handling, no standardization

3. **Direct API Integration in LLM**
   - Pros: No middleware needed
   - Cons: Each LLM would need custom GitLab integration, no reusability

### Rationale

MCP provides the best balance of standardization, reusability, and comprehensive functionality. By implementing a full-featured MCP server, we enable any MCP-compatible LLM to interact with GitLab without custom integration work.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Standardized GitLab access for all MCP-enabled LLMs
- Comprehensive tool coverage reduces need for custom scripts
- Local testing support accelerates development

**Negative:**
- Dependency on MCP protocol adoption
- Initial implementation complexity for 30+ tools

## 2025-01-09: Python Implementation Choice

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement MCP GitLab server in Python using python-gitlab library, asyncio for concurrency, and pydantic for data validation.

### Context

MCP servers can be implemented in any language. Choice of implementation language affects maintainability, performance, and ecosystem compatibility.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **TypeScript/Node.js**
   - Pros: Native MCP SDK support, good async handling
   - Cons: Less mature GitLab client libraries

2. **Go**
   - Pros: Better performance, single binary distribution
   - Cons: Less accessible to contributors, more complex MCP integration

### Rationale

Python offers the most mature GitLab client library (python-gitlab), excellent developer ecosystem, and good async support with asyncio. The python-gitlab library provides comprehensive coverage of GitLab API endpoints with proper error handling.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Leverage mature python-gitlab library
- Large contributor pool familiar with Python
- Good testing ecosystem with pytest

**Negative:**
- Python distribution can be complex
- Performance overhead compared to compiled languages

## 2025-01-09: Local Testing Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Contributors

### Decision

Implement comprehensive local testing stubs that simulate GitLab API responses without requiring network access or GitLab credentials.

### Context

Testing GitLab integrations typically requires a live GitLab instance or extensive mocking. This creates barriers for contributors and slows down development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **GitLab Docker Container**
   - Pros: Real GitLab behavior
   - Cons: Heavy resource usage, slow startup, requires licensing

2. **Mock Only in Tests**
   - Pros: Simpler implementation
   - Cons: Can't test actual tool behavior interactively

### Rationale

Local stubs that can be enabled via environment variable provide the best developer experience. Contributors can test changes without GitLab access, and the stubs can be used for interactive testing during development.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero-friction contribution experience
- Faster test execution
- No API rate limit concerns during development

**Negative:**
- Stubs must be maintained alongside real implementation
- Potential for stub/reality drift
